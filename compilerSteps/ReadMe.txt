How programs are loaded into memory and executed:
1. Compilation and Execution Pipeline
  Source Code: Written by the developer in a high-level language (e.g., C++)
  Compilation: The compiler translates the source code into machine code (binary instructions)
  Linking: The linker resolves external dependencies, combines code from multiple files or libraries, and produces a complete executable.
  Loading: The operating system (OS) loads the executable into memory and prepares it for execution.
  By the time the program is loaded into memory, its already in machine code, so no compiler is needed at runtime.

2. How a Program is Loaded and Started
  a. Loading the Program
    Executable Header Parsing: The OS reads the executable's header to understand:
    Where the code (instructions) and data are located.
    The entry point (the address of the first instruction to execute).
    Memory Mapping:
    The OS maps the program's code, initialized data, and uninitialized data into the process's memory space.
    It also sets up necessary resources like the stack and heap.
    Transfer Control:
    The OS transfers control to the entry point of the program (usually main or equivalent).
    The CPU starts executing the machine code instructions from this address.
  b. Execution
    The CPU begins executing instructions from the memory location specified by the entry point. Instructions are executed sequentially unless:
    There is a control flow instruction (e.g., jmp, call, ret) that changes the program counter (PC).
    An interrupt or exception occurs.
3. How Does the CPU Find the Next Instruction?
  The CPU uses a special register called the Program Counter (PC) or Instruction Pointer (IP):
  The PC holds the memory address of the next instruction to execute.
  After executing an instruction, the PC is automatically updated to point to the next instruction.
  For control flow instructions like branches or function calls, the PC is explicitly updated to the new target address.
4. Role of the Operating System (OS)
  The OS plays a critical role in executing programs:
  Program Loader: The OS's loader reads the executable file and prepares it for execution.
  Memory Management: The OS allocates memory for the program's code, data, stack, and heap.
  Context Switching: If multiple programs are running, the OS schedules and switches between them.
5. What Happens During Execution?
  When a program is executing:
  Instructions: The machine code executes directly on the CPU.
  System Calls: When the program needs to interact with hardware or the OS (e.g., file I/O, networking), it makes a system call.
  The CPU switches to kernel mode, and the OS handles the request.
  Interrupts and Exceptions: If an external event (like a timer or I/O completion) or an error occurs, the CPU executes an interrupt handler or exception handler.
6. Is a Compiler Needed at Runtime?
  Compiled Languages (e.g., C, C++):
  No compiler is needed at runtime because the program is already in machine code.
  The system executes the program directly.
  Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript):
  The source code is interpreted or just-in-time (JIT) compiled at runtime by an interpreter or runtime environment (e.g., Python interpreter).
  Hybrid Languages (e.g., Java, .NET):
  Source code is first compiled into bytecode (platform-independent intermediate code).
  At runtime, a virtual machine (JVM, CLR) or JIT compiler translates bytecode into machine code.
7. How Does a System Execute a Program?
  The system relies on:
  Bootloader: At startup, the CPU begins executing instructions from the ROM-resident bootloader, which loads the OS.
  Operating System: The OS manages program loading, execution, and resource allocation.
  Hardware: The CPU executes machine instructions, accessing memory and peripherals as needed.

Preprocessing: Outputs a single translation unit (pure C++ source code without directives).
  g++ -E program.cpp -o program.i
Compilation: Outputs a .s file (assembly code).
  g++ -S program.i -o program.s
Assembly: Outputs an object file (.o or .obj).
  g++ -c program.s -o program.o
Linking: Outputs an executable binary (.exe or ELF format on Linux).
  g++ program.o -o program

ANSWERS:

1. How Compilation and Program Execution Works?
Compilation Process in C++
When a C++ program is compiled, it goes through the following stages:

Preprocessing:

The preprocessor handles directives like #include, #define, and #ifdef.
Outputs a single translation unit (pure C++ source code without directives).
Command: g++ -E program.cpp -o program.i
Compilation:

The compiler converts the preprocessed source code into assembly code.
Outputs a .s file (assembly code).
Command: g++ -S program.i -o program.s
Assembly:

The assembler translates the assembly code into machine code.
Outputs an object file (.o or .obj).
Command: g++ -c program.s -o program.o
Linking:

The linker combines object files and libraries into an executable.
Resolves references between symbols (e.g., function calls).
Outputs an executable binary (.exe or ELF format on Linux).
Command: g++ program.o -o program
Execution Process
Loading:

The operating systems loader places the executable into memory.
For dynamically linked executables, shared libraries (.so) are also loaded.
Execution:

The CPU executes the machine code instructions starting from the entry point (e.g., main).
2. C++ Program Compilation Stages and Their Outputs
Stage	Description	Output
Preprocessing	Expands macros, processes includes, removes comments	.i file
Compilation	Converts preprocessed code into assembly code	.s file
Assembly	Converts assembly into machine code	.o (object file)
Linking	Resolves symbols and creates an executable binary	.exe or ELF file
3. How Static Library Behaves Differently Than Dynamic Library?
Aspect	Static Library (.a)	Dynamic Library (.so)
Linking Time	Included in the executable at compile time.	Linked at runtime.
File Size	Larger executable size (library embedded).	Smaller executable size (library separate).
Performance	Faster execution (no runtime linking).	Slight overhead due to runtime linking.
Updates	Requires recompilation to update.	Can be updated independently.
Distribution	Easier to distribute as a standalone binary.	Requires distributing the .so separately.
Memory Usage	Code is duplicated in every executable.	Shared across multiple processes.
5. How Invoking .exe is Different Than .so?
Aspect	.exe	.so
Nature	Self-contained executable program.	Shared library, loaded dynamically.
Execution	Directly executed by the OS loader.	Cannot be executed directly; must be linked.
Linking	Statically or dynamically linked.	Dynamically linked.
Invocation	Run from the command line or via system calls.	Loaded at runtime via dlopen() or linker.
6. How Memory Management Works in Case of .o, .so, and .exec?
Object File (.o):

Not loaded into memory for execution.
Contains machine code and metadata for the linker.
Memory is not managed for .o files directly; they are inputs for linking.
Shared Library (.so):

Loaded into memory at runtime.
Memory is shared among multiple processes, reducing overall memory usage.
The OS loader maps .so into a processs virtual address space.
Executable (.exe):

Fully loaded into memory by the OS loader.
Includes code, data, and stack/heap for execution.
7. Different Loading Mechanisms
Type	When Loaded	Who Loads It	Example
Static Library	At compile/link time.	Linker combines it into the executable.	Linking with .a file.
Dynamic Library	At runtime.	OS loader or dlopen().	libexample.so loaded dynamically.
Executable	At runtime.	OS loader.	Running ./program.
8. Meaning of Static Linking and Dynamic Linking
Static Linking:
Combines object files and libraries into a single executable during compilation.
The resulting binary is self-contained and does not depend on external libraries.
Example:
bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o program -L/path/to/static_lib -lstaticlib
Here, -lstaticlib links against a .a library.
Dynamic Linking:
Links the program to shared libraries (.so) at runtime.
Reduces executable size and enables library updates without recompilation.
Example:
bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o program -L/path/to/dynamic_lib -ldynamiclib
Here, -ldynamiclib links against a .so library.

Detailed Example
Static Linking Example:
Create a static library:
ar rcs libstaticlib.a staticlib.o
Link it statically:
g++ main.cpp -o program -L. -lstaticlib

Dynamic Linking Example:
Create a shared library:
g++ -fPIC -shared -o libdynamiclib.so dynamiclib.cpp
Link it dynamically:
g++ main.cpp -o program -L. -ldynamiclib
Run with LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
./program

At runtime, the dynamic linker/loader is responsible for linking and loading shared libraries (.so) into a process's memory.
Dynamic Linker/Loader:
On Linux: ld.so or ld-linux.so (depending on the architecture, e.g., ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 for 64-bit systems).
How the Dynamic Linker Works:
Identifies Dependencies:

The executable specifies required shared libraries in its ELF headers (via .dynamic section).
These are listed as DT_NEEDED entries in the ELF.
Loads Libraries:

Loads the .so libraries into memory.
Resolves their addresses in the process's address space.
Relocates Symbols:

Resolves symbols required by the executable from the shared library.
Updates the Global Offset Table (GOT) with the actual addresses of the shared functions.

How Linking .so is Different from Loading .exe or ELF?
Executable (e.g., ELF):
Self-contained:
Contains an entry point (e.g., _start or main).
Fully loaded by the OS loader into memory.
Static or Dynamic Linking:
If statically linked, all dependencies are embedded in the executable.
If dynamically linked, the loader resolves .so dependencies.
Shared Library (.so):
Dependent:
Cannot run independently.
Provides reusable functionality for other executables or libraries.
Lazy Linking:
Functions in .so may only be resolved when they are first called (lazy loading).
Aspect	Executable (.exe/ELF)	Shared Library (.so)
Entry Point	Has a fixed entry point (main).	No entry point (no main).
Linking Time	Fully linked at program load time.	Linked dynamically at runtime.
Usage	Standalone program.	Reused by multiple executables.
Loading Mechanism	OS loader directly loads it.	Dynamic linker (ld.so).

Exec, ELF formats
Program counter
Program's memory sections like code, initialized data, and uninitialized data etc


.execl() Key steps:

Replaces the Process Image:
The old program is discarded.
A new program (specified by the executable file) is loaded into memory.
Keeps Process Context:
The process retains the same PID and open file descriptors unless explicitly closed.
Does Not Return:
Once executed, the new program starts execution, and the original program ceases.

program is ELF here:
readelf -h program
readelf -S program

Key Sections of ELF:
Header:

Provides metadata about the file (e.g., type: executable, shared, object).
Fields like e_entry indicate the starting point of execution (entry point address).
Program Header Table:

Describes memory segments for the program loader.
Segments include code, data, and stack.
Section Header Table:

Contains metadata for sections (used during linking).
Includes .text (code), .data (initialized data), .bss (uninitialized data), etc.
ELF Sections:
Section	Purpose
.text	Contains executable instructions.
.data	Stores initialized global/static data.
.bss	Stores uninitialized global/static data (allocated but zero-initialized).
.rodata	Read-only constants (e.g., string literals).
.plt/.got	Used for dynamic linking.
